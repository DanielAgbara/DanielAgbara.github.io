        <p>
          As part of a collaborative design course, our multidisciplinary team set out to design an
          <strong>inclusive merry-go-round</strong> that enables <strong>children who use wheelchairs</strong> to participate safely and joyfully
          in playground activities. Guided by the principles of <strong>universal design</strong>, we created a solution that balances safety, accessibility, and fun.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission was rooted in creating a shared play experience—where <strong>all children</strong>, regardless of ability, can engage equally.
          To accomplish this, we conducted stakeholder interviews, developed multiple concept prototypes, and evaluated them using a structured decision-making process.
          Our final concept integrates a rotating platform, wheelchair-compatible seating, safety features, and a reliable drive mechanism—meeting both technical specifications and community needs.
        </p>

        <h3>Mission Statement</h3>
        <p>
          We aimed to build a play structure that embodies inclusivity and celebrates diversity. The project’s mission focused on creating a
          <strong>safe, accessible, and engaging</strong> playground experience where all children could play and make memories together—
          especially those who often face barriers in traditional playgrounds.

        <h3>Stakeholder Analysis</h3>
        <p>We identified and prioritized the following key stakeholder groups:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Children with Disabilities:</strong> The primary users; their safety, accessibility needs, and user experience were central.</li>
          <li><strong>Parents and Caregivers:</strong> Focused on ease of use, reliability, and comfort while ensuring child safety.</li>
          <li><strong>Local Community:</strong> Emphasized the broader social benefit, inclusion, and neighborhood impact.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Input was collected via <strong>interviews, surveys, and secondary research</strong>, helping shape the project’s design constraints and usability goals.
        </p>

        <h3>Target Specifications</h3>
        <p>Based on stakeholder feedback, the following features were defined as essential:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Rotating Platform:</strong> The central base enabling movement and engagement.</li>
          <li><strong>Wheelchair-Compatible Seating:</strong> Secure, flush-mounted spaces for easy wheelchair access without needing to transfer.</li>
          <li><strong>Safety Barriers and Handrails:</strong> Prevent falls and provide support.</li>
          <li><strong>Drive Mechanism:</strong> Ensures smooth, controlled rotation (manual or motorized, depending on final concept refinement).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Concept Generation</h3>

          <figcaption>Concept 3</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>We used a structured process involving:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Market research and analysis of existing inclusive playground equipment.</li>
          <li>Brainstorming sessions to generate creative and feasible solutions.</li>
          <li>Feedback from experts and iterative refinement of ideas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Concept Design Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Each of the three proposed concepts offered different layouts and drive solutions. Although the presentation does not detail each version visually, they likely included variations on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Platform size and rotation method</li>
          <li>Seating arrangement for children with and without mobility devices</li>
          <li>Safety mechanisms (e.g., barrier style, seatbelts)</li>
          <li>Potential manual vs. electric drive mechanisms</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Concept Selection</h3>
        <figure class="content-figure">
          <img src="../media/selection.png" alt="Inclusive Merry-Go-Round">
          <figcaption>Selection Matrix</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          A <strong>decision matrix</strong> was used to objectively compare the three concepts. Criteria included:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Safety</li>
          <li>Accessibility</li>
          <li>Durability</li>
          <li>Cost-effectiveness</li>
          <li>User enjoyment</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The final design was selected for its balanced performance across all categories and strong alignment with both technical feasibility and stakeholder expectations.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          This project was more than just a technical challenge—it was a mission to make play accessible. By centering the voices of children with disabilities and their communities,
          we created a thoughtful design that fosters <strong>inclusion, equity, and joy</strong>. The Merry-Go-Round prototype stands as a symbol of what engineering can achieve
          when guided by empathy, collaboration, and purpose.
