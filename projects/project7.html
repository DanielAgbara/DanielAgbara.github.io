          As part of a commissioned design initiative by the CEO of <strong>Green Ventures Tanzania</strong>, I was tasked with developing six innovative chair designs for a new line of sustainable, ergonomic seating products. These chairs were intended to combine
          <strong>environmental responsibility</strong>, <strong>modern aesthetics</strong>, and <strong>evidence-based ergonomic support</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The designs drew on medical and biomechanical principles to reduce pressure on the pelvis and improve posture, especially during extended sitting sessions.
        </p>

        <p>
          This project was informed by research on seat tilt and discomfort caused by prolonged weight on the ischial bones. As shown in the reference material (image provided), pressure hotspots are created when sitting on a flat surface, restricting circulation and causing discomfort. To address this, several of the chair designs featured:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Subtle seat tilt</strong> to promote natural posture and redistribute weight</li>
          <li><strong>Contoured seating surfaces</strong> to avoid shearing forces and slippage</li>
          <li><strong>Integrated backrest angles</strong> that reduce pressure when reclining</li>
          <li>Designs that enable reclining while preventing forward slide</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Concepts</h3>
        <p>
          I developed six unique chairs, each exploring a specific approach to sustainability and ergonomics:</p>

        <h3>Discussion</h3>
        <p>
          This project allowed me to merge <strong>sustainable design</strong> with <strong>biomechanical insights</strong>, resulting in chairs that are not just beautiful and planet-friendly, but also informed by <strong>human anatomy and comfort science</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          My interest in this work stemmed from a broader fascination with <strong>robot simulation and human-centered design</strong>, where I can simulate both human behavior and interaction with physical environments. Designing for the human body in a digital space helped me bridge the gap between conceptual CAD and real-world posture mechanicsâ€”valuable skills I plan to further develop in robotics and product design.
