      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I am a Mechanical Engineer currently pursuing a Master’s degree at the University of Texas at Austin. I earned my Bachelor’s degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science from Drexel University — a combination driven by my deep interest in Robotics and Automation, particularly in the areas of Control Systems, Dynamics, and Reinforcement Learning.</p>
      <p>My passion lies in building intelligent robots and autonomous systems that have real-world impact. I believe that advancements in robotics and automation are key to driving the next wave of human innovation by enhancing productivity, efficiency, and safety across industries.</p>
      <p>This portfolio is more than just a showcase — it’s a living record of my accomplishments and a reflection of the professional experiences that shape my journey.</p>
      <p>I'm always open to working on exciting projects in robotics and automation, and I enjoy meeting like-minded individuals who share the same enthusiasm for innovation—whether it's through online collaboration or in-person events.</p>
      <p>Feel free to connect with me via [LinkedIn] using the link in the header to start a conversation.</p>

        <h3>Lane Detection and Control System</h3>
        <p>
          For my senior design project, I collaborated with the Zhou Robotics Lab and three other Drexel University students to develop a lane detection and control system that ensures a robot car maintains its lane in a mock city. This project was part of the lab’s Autonomous Navigation Testbed Development.

        <h3>Frogger Reinforcement Learning Agent</h3>
        <p>
          Reinforcement Learning is a powerful approach for training autonomous systems through interaction with their environment. In this project, I implemented a Q-Learning algorithm to train an AI agent capable of successfully playing and winning the classic Frogger arcade game across varying difficulty levels — Easy, Medium, and Hard.

        <h3>Planar 2R Robot Manipulator Simulation</h3>
        <p>
          Numerical Methods are great tools for Mechanical Engineering Design. This project involved developing a numerical simulation of a planar 2R robotic manipulator subjected to time-varying joint torques. The purpose was to model, solve, and visualize the dynamic response of the manipulator using multiple numerical integration techniques, while analyzing motion, energy, and power consumption over time.

        <h3>Knight Trials</h3>
        <p>
          Knight Trials is a collaborative game development project created by a team of three students at Drexel University. Designed to challenge players’ strategy and reflexes, the game immerses them in a medieval fantasy world where they must prove themselves as worthy defenders of the Realm. Players journey through three uniquely designed elemental mazes—Earth, Ice, and Mud—each presenting distinct terrain mechanics, environmental hazards, and dynamic enemy encounters.
